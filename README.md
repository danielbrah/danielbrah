Hello, my name is Daniel! I am interested in web development. I have a good knowledge of HTML, CSS, JS, and SCSS. I am currently learning JavaScript. DOM manipulation is the main thing I am focusing on right now for JavaScript. I may use frameworks like React or Vue in the future if I get the hang of using JavaScript. You can reach me via email | daniel.jimenezfrancisco@gmail.com.
